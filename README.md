# DALL·E Playground

I just got off the waiting list for DALL·E and began playing around. Because the first results were, frankly, a bit bizarre and dialed in than other examples I've seen, I decided to download everything here so I can puzzle out what's going on. 

## 1. painting of an opossum and a crow eating lunch together at an outdoor cafe

This was the first phrase I tried. The painterly effects are excellent and the setting in each image is clearly of different interpretations of outdoor dining situations, but for some reason, DALL·E is insisting on making a crow/possum chimera of at least one of the two characters. One of them is generally possum-like, but neither of them is clearly a crow.
