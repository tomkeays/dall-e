# DALL·E Playground

I just got off the waiting list for **[DALL·E](https://labs.openai.com/)** and began playing around. Because the first results were, frankly, a bit bizarre and way less dialed in than other examples I've seen, I decided to download everything here so I can puzzle out what's going on.

### 1. painting of an opossum and a crow eating lunch together at an outdoor cafe

This was the first phrase I tried. The painterly effects are excellent and the setting in each image is clearly depicting an interpretation of an outdoor dining situation, but for some reason, DALL·E is insisting on making a crow/possum chimera of at least one of the two characters. One of them is generally possum-like, but neither of them is clearly a crow.

### 2. painting of an opossum and a crow eating lunch at an outdoor cafe

I thought maybe the word "together" was causing the chimera. But... nope.

### 3. crow dressed as the grim reaper

Is the problem that DALL·E doesn't understand what crows are? Seemed unlikely and this request nails crows pretty well. Although, I'd have to say these guys look more like Harry Dresden than the Grim Reaper. And what's going on with that last guy?

### 4. painting of a crow eating lunch at an outdoor cafe with an opossum

Back to the crow and opossum query, I tried separating the two parties in the structure of the sentence. English allows this kind of thing, although the grammar is probably becoming terrible. But even the phrase, "painting of a crow eating lunch at an outdoor cafe" is failing to get a recognizable crow and the possum is, if anything, even stranger.

### 5. painting of a crow eating lunch at an outdoor cafe

Alright, let's just ask for a crow without the possum. Success! Everything looks pretty good, although crow number 3 seems to be using an arm to eat with.

So, we have to puzzle out how to phrase things to show both critters together at the table without any chimeras.

### 6. painting of an outdoor cafe with a crow and an opossum eating together

These images are really nailing the outdoor cafe setting, but the animals are getting stranger.
